You can calculate the exact internal electric field using scripts in the Mie_solution folder.

You can calculate the WKBr internal electric field using scripts in the WKBr folder (so far only for spheres).

You can calculate figures 15 and 16 from the paper using cluster and scripts in Cluster folder. These scripts use checkpoints (read the ADDA manual). Otherwise, you can run Fig 15.sh and Fig 16.sh scripts that do not use checkpoints. It is assumed that computer / cluster resources for calculations are provided for an unlimited time.

All scripts are presented as examples and can help reproduce the paper results. In addition, in each case, you need to make sure that the scripts use the necessary parameters and paths to files. In other words, you need to manually configure scripts before using them. However, despite this, we believe that scripts can be useful.
