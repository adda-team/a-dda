### Structure

* `Cluster/` - scripts for working with the cluster
* `Mie_solution/` - scripts for exact internal electric field calculations
* `WKBr/` – scripts for WKBr internal electric field calculations
* `Fig 15.sh, Fig 16.sh` – data calculation scripts for figures of the same name from the paper

All scripts are presented as examples and can help reproduce the paper results. In addition, in each case, you need to make sure that the scripts use the necessary parameters and paths to files. In other words, you need to manually configure scripts before using them. However, despite this, we believe that scripts can be useful.
