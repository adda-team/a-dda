ADDA Wrapper
2021.08 Version 0.6
2022.02 Version 0.7. Optimized to work under Windows. Added a function "varyany" to vary anyb of the desired variable  in ADDA, for example, "mhost" to see how Peels changes when the Cherenkov effect starts.
2022.08 Version 0.8 Added geometry file visualization, supporting different colors for different domains.

Script performs batch simulations using ADDA. For more info read the following articles. The easiest way to see how it works is to go to /adda/examples/eels/ and run any of the examples.
