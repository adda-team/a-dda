Script performs batch simulations using ADDA. For more info read the following articles. The easiest way to see how it works is to go to /adda/examples/eels/ and run any of the examples.

For more info read the following articles.
ADDA: Maxim A. Yurkin, "User Manual for the Discrete Dipole Approximation Code ADDA"
EELS and CL: Kichigin&Yurkin, "Simulating Electron-energy-loss Spectroscopy and Cathodoluminescence in the Discrete Dipole Approximation"
Extrapolation: Yurkin et al., "Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. II. An extrapolation technique to increase the accuracy"
