* `run000_sphere_g16_m1.5/` – sample output directory
  * `log` - log of sample simulation
  * `mueller` - sample angle-resolved Mueller matrix
  * `CrossSec-Y` - sample cross sections
* `stdout` – standard output of a sample simulation
* `test.pbs` – sample PBS script for MPI system
* `test.sge` – sample SGE script for MPI system
